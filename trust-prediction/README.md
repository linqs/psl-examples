### Trust Prediction

## Problem

In this example, we attempt to discover the level of trust between two individuals.

## Dataset

The dataset originally came from the Epinions social network.
It contains some positive and negative examples of trust in the network along with the structural information
of the network (ie who knows who).

## Origin

This example is a simplified version of one of the experiments from Bach et al.'s core PSL paper:
"Hinge-Loss Markov Random Fields and Probabilistic Soft Logic":
```
@article{bach:jmlr17,
  Author = {Bach, Stephen H. and Broecheler, Matthias and Huang, Bert and Getoor, Lise},
  Journal = {Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR)},
  Title = {Hinge-Loss {M}arkov Random Fields and Probabilistic Soft Logic},
  Year = {2017}
}
```
