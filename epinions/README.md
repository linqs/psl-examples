### Epinions

## Problem

In this example, we attempt to discover the level of trust between two individuals.

## Dataset

It contains some positive and negative examples of trust in the network along with the structural information
of the network (ie who knows who).

## Origin

This example is one of the experiments from Bach et al.'s core PSL paper:
"Hinge-Loss Markov Random Fields and Probabilistic Soft Logic":
```

  Journal = {Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR)},
  Title = {Hinge-Loss {M}arkov Random Fields and Probabilistic Soft Logic},
  Year = {2017}
}
```
